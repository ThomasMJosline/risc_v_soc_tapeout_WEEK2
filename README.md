# RISC-V SOC tapeout program : Week1

# Introduction to BabySoC & Functional Modelling

---

**Objective** : To build a solid understanding of SoC fundamentals and practice functional modelling of the BabySoC using simulation tools (Icarus Verilog & GTKWave).

### 1. **Introduction on SoC**

 - SoC (System on Chip): These are integrated circuit chips that have multiple components (IPs) in it, forming complete system, within a single chiip. These could be digital or analog components. 
 - These chips can include components such as central processing unit, memory components, input-output interfaces, timers, secondary storage units etc.
